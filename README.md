Hey.

As I've mentioned, I'll be pretty busy in the next few weeks, and I won't be able to clean-up the codebase very much in the short-term.
Therefore, I have decided to provide the code as is. Please use, change, break and comment as you will.

Please feel free to ask questions about using the simulation or where to find stuff as they come up in the repository here.
